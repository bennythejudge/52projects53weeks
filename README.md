# 52 projects in 53 weeks

# week 1 - 2020-01-01 to 2020-01-05

During this first week I have been working on the following:

- CKA preparation - maybe it's not exactly a "coding" task, but I am counting YAML as coding. I have done a bit of [tasks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks), a bit of Game Of Pods, a bit of course and I have registered for the exam, setting the date to 2020-02-04, Tuesday, from 10.00 to 13.00

- FreeCodeCamp: I have made progress in the Responsive Web Design Certification, and I have (re)started the Responsive Web Design Projects, reviewing the [first one, the tribute page](https://codepen.io/logube/full/wGPvjE), which I had already completed a long time ago. It needed work and I added the new self-testing feature.

- WebDevelopment course by Angela Yu on udemy: I am going through the HTML and CSS chapters, which in theory I could have skipped - but who am I kidding? Being a zero is a full time job.
